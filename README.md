Towers of Hanoi in Excel

Instructions: Move all the discs from the left section to the right section in as few moves as possible. Larger discs cannot be placed on top of smaller discs. To move a disc, click anywhere in the section the disc is in, then click in the section where you want to move the disc. You can click anywhere above or below the disc, so long as you click in the section, the top-most disc will be selected. Optionally, you may use the keyboard to perform the moves. The left section is 1, middle is 2, the right is 3. So to move a disc from the left to the right would be 13. To move from the middle to the right would be 23. Right to left 31. Etc. Good luck!
